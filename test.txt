The Role of Cytokines and Chemokines in the Inflammatory Response to Infection: From Immune Mechanisms to Therapeutic Implications and Cytokine Storm in COVID-19



Inflammation is a sophisticated biological reaction that happens as a result of bacterial or viral infection. The inflammatory response to infection is a complex biological phenomenon mediated by various molecular and cellular components. Cytokines and chemokines, as key mediators of the immune response, play critical roles in orchestrating the recruitment, activation and differentiation of immune cells to the site of infection (JW;, 2003). These molecules are crucial for the beginning and upkeep of a powerful host defence system and are produced by a wide variety of cell types, including but not restricted to macrophages and T-lymphocytes. In this essay, we aim to delve into the intricacies of the inflammatory response to infection, with a specific focus on the functions and potential therapeutic implications of these mediators.



In response to infection, immune system cells release a class of proteins called cytokines (JEstcourtEnvelope et al., 2002). By delivering immune cells, such as white blood cells, to the infection site and activating them there, they play a crucial part in controlling the inflammatory response. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are a few cytokines that are crucial in the inflammatory response (Radu & Bungau, 2021). Afterward, immune cells are drawn to and activited by pro-inflammatory substances like IL-1 or IL-6. Contrarily, TNF-α is a cytotoxic cytokine that encourages the lysis of infected cells. On the other hand, chemokines are a subgroup of cytokines that have the special purpose of luring leukocytes (white blood cells) to the site of infection. They are tiny chemoattractant proteins that attach to particular leukocyte surface receptors to encourage leukocyte migration to the infection site. For instance, it is understood that the chemokines CXCL8, commonly know as IL-8, and CCL2, commonly know as MCP-1, attract neutrophils and monocytes to the infection site, respectively (Moore and Clark, 2016).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) will damage the host tissue when they are produced as a result of bacterial and viral infection(Blackman et al., 2014). This injury can lead to the production of chemokines like IL-8, MIP-1, and MCP-1 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 (Blackman et al., 2014). As a result, a constructive feedback loop is created, amplifying the inflammatory response. And a number of cell types should work together to produce diverse mediators as part of the intricate immune response to infection. Through their ability to encourage the activation and recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, cytokines and chemokines play significant roles in this process (JW;, 2003). It's crucial to remember that an excessive or protracted production of these chemicals can result in tissue damage and ongoing inflammation Therefore, a good immune response to infection depends on the balance of cytokine and chemokine production.



To beginning, I would like to make clear a concept: when cytokines or chemokines respond to inflammation brought on by bacterial or viral infection, they will result in a condition brought on by an unchecked or unbalanced production of cytokines or chemokines. Cytokine storm is a common term used to describe this condition. In general, cytokine storms can happen frequently and can result in organ failure or severe tissue damage in addition to systemic inflammatory responses (Fajgenbaum & June, 2020). In the information that follows, I want to link cytokine storm to COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 Virus), which has been epidemiced extensively around the world in the last three years, and describe its pertinent mechanism, symptoms, and current treatment approaches in greater depth.



Since the winter of 2019, COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic after it first broke out in Hubei, China. It has also resulted in more than 4 million infections in just six months as of May 2020, and what's even more frightful is that the fatality rate is as high as 7%（WHO,2020）. Fever, cough, myalgia, and weariness are typical early-stage infection symptoms. Later-stage symptoms include dyspnea, which could potentially cause multiple organ failure or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Furthermore, 15.6% of patients with severe pneumonia among 1099 hospitalised COVID-19 patients reported having acute respiratory distress syndrome (Guan et al., 2020). Scientists have become concerned in the phenomena of ARDS, which affects a very high percentage of critically ill patients. Meantime, Feng et al.19, COVID-19 severe cases are caused by a heightened immune response (cytokine storm) brought on by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Feng et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is asserted that thrombosis, severe lymphopenia, high levels of circulating cytokines, and substantial mononuclear cell infiltration in several organs are the main contributors to the severity of the disease and mortality in covid-19 patients (Merad & Martin, 2020).



Notably, patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 exhibited massive protein aggregation and inflammatory infiltration of interstitial mononuclear cells in alveolar spaces, in addition to lung disease including edoema and pneumocyte growth. This indicates that a significant number of cytokines are locally released in an excessive amount, leading to the infiltration of inflammatory cells (Xu et al., 2020). In general, significant lung harm in COVID-19 individuals is typically caused by immune over-activation and direct viral infection. According to the cytokine storm theory, once SARS-CoV-2 cells have entered the respiratory epithelial cells, they trigger an inflammatory immune response, quickly activate pathogenic Th1 cells, and release pro-inflammatory cytokines such GM-CSF and interleukin-6 (IL-6)(Hussman, 2020). It is accompanied with a modest interferon (IFN) reaction at the same time. Following the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into lung tissue, IL-6 and TNF-α are produced. IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-10, IP-10, and MCP-1 levels were higher in individuals with severe illness than in those with mild or moderate infection, according to a number of studies (Liu et al., 2020). TNF-α, macrophage inflammatory protein, and granulocyte-csf levels are higher. Significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN- and IL-4 were also observed (Liu et al., 2020). Therefore,Cytokine storm is brought on by the gene's excessive expression.



As a result, COVID-19 treatment should concentrate on preventing and reducing the cytokine storm brought on by the excessive production of cytokines. The following three situations are commonly used in clinical practise to treat COVID-19 and address the problems caused by overly strong immunity.

Hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine)

Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are often used in therapeutic settings because of their in vitro antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties (L;, 2020). The discovery that low dosages of CQ and HCQ may be able to suppress the cytokine storm generated by COVID-19 patients is even more remarkable. A considerable reduction in CD154 expression in T cells caused by CQ and HCQ effectively prevents the release of IL-6 and TNF (Savarino et al., 2003).



Mesenchymal stem cells

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be able to limit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as the aberrant activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, among other immune regulatory roles, according to a large body of clinical data (NK;, 2015). Additionally, clinical investigations of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19 have demonstrated that MSCs can considerably and swiftly ameliorate severe clinical symptoms (Leng et al., 2020). Moreover, no negative side effects have been noted. However, clinical studies on MSCs are still being conducted, yet as of right now, little is known about the COVID-19 treatment's efficacy and safety.



3.Anakinra

IL-1 and IL-1, two pro-inflammatory cytokines, can be produced less frequently when an IL-1 receptor antagonist called anakinra is administered. Studies by certain academics indicate that it can successfully control cytokine storms and enhance respiration and can increase COVID-19 patients' chances of survival (Cavalli et al., 2020).



In conclusion, cytokines and chemokines have important functions in the inflammatory response to infection when they are combined. They are created by the immune system in response to infection and are in charge of attracting and mobilising immune cells to the infection site. They also work as a positive feedback loop to amplify the inflammatory response. The creation of these chemicals, however, can cause chronic inflammation and tissue damage if it is excessive or ongoing. A cytokine storm results from this, which is an excessive or unregulated synthesis of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6, which are essential for the start and upkeep of strong host defensive systems. However, the creation of these compounds in excess or over a prolonged period of time can cause serious tissue damage and organ failure. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend the intricate interactions between cytokines and chemokines during the immune response to infection in order to develop new therapeutic approaches for the management of infectious diseases and long-term inflammatory diseases.
