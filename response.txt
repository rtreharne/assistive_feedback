The reference list provided does not adhere to the Harvard referencing style. Firstly, it includes URLs as references, which is not appropriate for academic writing. Instead, students should aim to find the original source of the information and cite that. Secondly, the references are not in alphabetical order by the first author's surname, which is a requirement of the Harvard referencing style. Specifically, "Jun-Ming Zhang et al, 2007" should come before "Lana Barham et al, 2022".

Additionally, it's important to note that the use of media sources (e.g., verywellhealth.com) is not suitable for academic work. Students should strive to find primary sources, such as peer-reviewed journal articles or books, to ensure the credibility and reliability of their references.

Finally, it's important to check for duplicated references. In this case, there are no duplicated references, which is good practice.

In summary, to improve the reference list, the student should ensure that references are in the correct Harvard format, listed in alphabetical order, and derived from reliable primary sources.
